# classes

* TrackData
  - Multiple segments
  - addSegment, addPointToSegment, getSegments, getAllPoints etc.

* TrackSegmentIndexed

  * Has virtual and internal index - useful to have index starting from nonzero
  * slicing by internal or virtual interval
  * slice to TrackSegmentIndexed or TrackSegment
  * zoom function

* TrackPointIndex
  - geospatial index for a list of points
  - it is possible to obtain nearest point of list for a given refpoint

* ElevationChart
  - uses TrackSegmentIndexed as prop
 
* MapView
  - uses LineStringFeature as prop
  - uses TrackPointIndex
  - does not know about segments 

* Track2GeoJson
  - reformats Segment to LineStringFeature

* App.vue
